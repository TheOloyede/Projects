This project is aim to explore the sales of bike in europe, and United States is been used as case study. 

Data Loading and Exploration:
The code loads a sales dataset from a https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadiqshah/bike-sales-in-europe and explores the data using functions like head(), info(), describe(), and shape.
Data Cleaning and Transformation:
	
The code performs data cleaning operations such as converting columns to datetime format using pd.to_datetime().
New columns are created by combining existing columns using the apply() function and lambda expressions.
Missing values are checked using isnull().sum().

Data Analysis and Visualization:
The code calculates various statistical measures like mean and median using the mean() and median() functions.
Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn libraries, including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, density plots, histograms, and pie charts.
Insights can be derived from the visualizations, such as sales distribution by country, product category, age group, and revenue analysis based on different factors.

Country-Specific Analysis: The code focuses on analyzing sales data specifically for the United States, including state-wise sales, product category breakdown, gender-based sales, and sales performance metrics.

Summary Insights: By examining the code, we can gain insights into various aspects of the sales dataset, including sales trends, revenue distribution, popular products, customer demographics, sales by age group, country-specific analysis, and correlations between variables.
