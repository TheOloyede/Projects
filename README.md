This project aims to explore the sales of bikes in Europe, with the United States being used as a case study.

Data Loading and Exploration:
The dataset was from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sadiqshah/bike-sales-in-europe and explores the data using functions like head(), info(), describe(), and shape.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The data was cleaned using different operations, such as converting columns to datetime format using pd.to_datetime(). New columns are created by combining existing columns using the apply() function and lambda expressions. Missing values are checked using isnull().sum().

Data Analysis and Visualization:
Various statistical measures like mean and median using the mean() and median() functions were used for calculations. Visualizations are created using matplotlib and seaborn libraries, including line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, density plots, histograms, and pie charts. Insights can be derived from the visualizations, such as sales distribution by country, product category, age group, and revenue analysis based on different factors.

Country-Specific Analysis: The code focuses on analyzing sales data specifically for the United States, including state-wise sales, product category breakdown, gender-based sales, and sales performance metrics.

Summary Insights: We gained insights into various aspects of the sales dataset, including sales trends, revenue distribution, popular products, customer demographics, sales by age group, country-specific analysis, and correlations between variables.
